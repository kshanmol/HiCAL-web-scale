# HiCAL-web-scale
Proof of concept version of HiCAL for a web-scale dataset. This version is meant to be set up and run only on the longhorn server in UWaterloo. The code in this repository can be used as a reference.

The web scale protocol implementation can be found in - HiCAL-web-scale/CALEngine/src/bmi_disk.cc
The helper scripts that the above file calls can be found in - HiCAL-web-scale/zpipe

Warning: This project is *not* meant to be run as-is because it works with data in hardcoded locations on the longhorn server. For the working version, go to /home/a536sing/hical-disk/HiCAL on longhorn.
